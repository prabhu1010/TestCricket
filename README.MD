Test Cricket Simulator
----------------------

My web page http://www.code-bits.net/testsim.htm has a more detailed description of this application.

This application was made for fans of the sport of Cricket, Test Cricket to be precise. It uses the Monte Carlo simulator technique to produce realistic simulations of Cricket matches.

Unfortunately, since the app was written in 2001, and it's code stored in those ancient 1.44MB floppy disks, it was only a matter of years before the disks got corrupted. 

Thankfully I had a copy of the data files and the executable, so that is all we will find here.

I have been thinking of writing a V 2.0 for this app, with some changes to the algorithm, so once that is done, there should be some real code in here.
